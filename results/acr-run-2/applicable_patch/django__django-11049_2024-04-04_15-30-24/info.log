2024-04-04 15:31:52 Raw model response: ChatCompletionMessage(content='Based on the search results, we have identified two relevant `DurationField` classes within the Django codebase:\n\n1. **In `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`**:\n   - This version of `DurationField` is used within Django models. It has a default error message defined for invalid formats, which is exactly the subject of the issue reported. The error message currently suggests the format `"[DD] [HH:[MM:]]ss[.uuuuuu]"`, which, according to the issue, is incorrect.\n   - The class contains several methods, but notably, there\'s no `clean` method found, which is commonly associated with form fields rather than model fields. This suggests that the validation error might be generated in one of these methods or through the form field representation of this model field.\n\n2. **In `django/forms/fields.py`**:\n   - This `DurationField` is used within Django forms. It has a simpler default error message that just asks for a valid duration, without specifying the format. It also mentions an \'overflow\' error message related to the number of days.\n   - Similar to the model field, this form field version of `DurationField` does not have a `clean` method, which was not found in the search. The validation and error messaging might be happening in the `to_python` method or elsewhere in the form field logic.\n\nGiven the issue description and the search results, the next steps to address the issue would involve:\n\n1. **Correcting the Error Message**: The error message in the model field version of `DurationField` (`django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`) needs to be updated to reflect the correct format. According to the issue, the correct format should be `"[DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu]"`, where seconds are mandatory, and minutes and hours are optional but in a specific order.\n\n2. **Adding Help Text**: The issue also suggests adding default `help_text` to both the model and form field versions of `DurationField` to make the expected format clear to users. This would likely involve modifying the `__init__` method or the properties of the `DurationField` classes to include a `help_text` argument with the correct format as its value.\n\n3. **Further Investigation**: Since the `clean` method was not found, it\'s possible that the actual validation and error handling are happening in methods like `to_python` or through other mechanisms. A closer look at these methods, especially in the form field version, might be necessary to ensure that the error message and help text are correctly implemented and displayed.\n\nThese steps would address the issue by correcting the misleading error message and improving the user guidance for entering durations in Django applications.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)
