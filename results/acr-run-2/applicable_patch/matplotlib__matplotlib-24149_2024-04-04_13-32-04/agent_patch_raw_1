```

This modification in `_safe_first_finite` function aims to handle the scenario where all input data are NaNs more gracefully by returning `np.nan` instead of raising a `StopIteration` exception. This change ensures that the calling functions, like `_convert_dx`, can continue their execution even when faced with all NaN inputs, thus preventing the exception that was originally reported in the issue.
