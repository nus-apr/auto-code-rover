2024-04-04 13:35:04 Raw model response: ChatCompletionMessage(content='Based on the information collected from the search results, we can make several observations relevant to the issue at hand:\n\n1. **No Direct Reference to `StyleLibrary` Class**: The search did not find a class named `StyleLibrary` in the codebase, which suggests that the management of style libraries might not be encapsulated within a single class with that name. This means we might need to look at how styles are managed more broadly within matplotlib.\n\n2. **`use` Method in `core.py`**: The `use` method found in `lib/matplotlib/style/core.py` is particularly relevant to our issue. This method is responsible for applying Matplotlib style settings from a style specification. Notably, it contains logic to handle style names, including those prefixed with "seaborn". The code snippet shows that seaborn styles are deprecated since version 3.6 and suggests using \'seaborn-v0_8-<style>\' instead. This directly relates to the issue, as the KeyError for "seaborn-colorblind" could be due to this deprecation and renaming.\n\n3. **Deprecation Warning for Seaborn Styles**: The `use` method emits a deprecation warning for seaborn styles, indicating that the styles previously shipped by Matplotlib are deprecated as of version 3.6. Instead, these styles are available under new names prefixed with \'seaborn-v0_8-\'. This is a crucial piece of information because it explains why the key "seaborn-colorblind" might not be found in the style library in version 3.6.1. The style\'s correct name in this version would be "seaborn-v0_8-colorblind".\n\n4. **No Direct Hits for `plt.style.library`**: The search did not return results for direct references to `plt.style.library`, suggesting that the issue might not be with the direct manipulation of this library but rather with how styles are registered or recognized within the broader styling system of matplotlib.\n\nGiven this context, the issue seems to stem from the deprecation and renaming of seaborn styles in Matplotlib version 3.6. The solution would involve updating the code to use the new style names or directly using seaborn\'s API for applying styles. Let\'s proceed to draft a patch based on this analysis.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

             'the management of style libraries might not be encapsulated within a single class with that name. This means we might need to look at how styles '
             'are managed more broadly within matplotlib.\n'
             '\n'
             '2. **`use` Method in `core.py`**: The `use` method found in `lib/matplotlib/style/core.py` is particularly relevant to our issue. This method is '
             'responsible for applying Matplotlib style settings from a style specification. Notably, it contains logic to handle style names, including those '
             'prefixed with "seaborn". The code snippet shows that seaborn styles are deprecated since version 3.6 and suggests using \'seaborn-v0_8-<style>\' '
             'instead. This directly relates to the issue, as the KeyError for "seaborn-colorblind" could be due to this deprecation and renaming.\n'
             '\n'
             '3. **Deprecation Warning for Seaborn Styles**: The `use` method emits a deprecation warning for seaborn styles, indicating that the styles '
             'previously shipped by Matplotlib are deprecated as of version 3.6. Instead, these styles are available under new names prefixed with '
             '\'seaborn-v0_8-\'. This is a crucial piece of information because it explains why the key "seaborn-colorblind" might not be found in the style '
             'library in version 3.6.1. The style\'s correct name in this version would be "seaborn-v0_8-colorblind".\n'
             '\n'
             '4. **No Direct Hits for `plt.style.library`**: The search did not return results for direct references to `plt.style.library`, suggesting that '
             'the issue might not be with the direct manipulation of this library but rather with how styles are registered or recognized within the broader '
