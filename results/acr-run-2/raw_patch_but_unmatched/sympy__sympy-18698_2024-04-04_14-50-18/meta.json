The squarefree methods are intended for univariate polynomials. The generator should be given as an input parameter. It may be omitted if there is no danger of confusion (only one symbol in the expression). Otherwise the result may be indeterminate as shown by the [example above](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/8695#issuecomment-522278244).\n@jksuom, I'm still unclear. There is already an option to pass generators as an argument to sqf_list(). Should the function automatically find the generators present in the expression? Please guide me what should I do. \nIf there is only one symbol in the expression, then the function can find the generator automatically. Otherwise I think that exactly one symbol should be given as the generator.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I would like to change the implementations of `sqf_list()` and related functions so that they would be based on the corresponding `Poly` methods. Then they would start by converting the input expression into `p = Poly(f, *gens, **args)` and check that `p` has exactly one generator. Then `p.sqf_list()` etc, would be called.\nThen what will happen in case of multiple generators? Just confirming, generators here refer to symbols/variables.\n> generators here refer to symbols/variables.\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n> Then what will happen in case of multiple generators?\r\n\r\nI think that ValueError could be raised. It seems that some kind of result is currently returned but there is no documentation, and I don't know of any reasonable use where the ordinary factorization would not suffice.\n> If there is only one symbol in the expression, then the function can find the generator automatically.

Then `p.sqf_list()` etc, would be called.\r\n\r\n@jksuom  In the helper function __symbolic_factor_list_ of sqf_list, the expression is already being converted to polynomial and then corresponding _sqf_list_ function is called. So, I should just ensure if the number of generators passed is one?\n> I should just ensure if the number of generators passed is one?\r\n\r\nIf there is exactly one generator passed, then it is possible to call `_generic_factor_list` with the given arguments. However, it is necessary to post-process the result. In the example above, it returns\r\n\r\n    (1, [(x**2 + 1, 1), (x - 1, 2), (x - 3, 3), (x - 2, 3)])\r\n\r\nwhile `sqf_list` should return only one polynomial for each power. Therefore the two threefold factors `x - 3` and `x - 2` should be combined to give a single `(x**2 - 5*x + 6, 3)`.\r\n\r\nIt is probably quite common that no generators are given, in particular, when the expression looks like a univariate polynomial. This should be acceptable but more work is then necessary to find the number of generators. I think that it is best to convert the expression to a `Poly` object to see the generators. If there is only one, then the `sqf_list` method can be called, otherwise a `ValueError` should be raised.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the latter procedure will be more efficient even if a single generator is given.\n@jksuom I have created a PR (#18307)for the issue. I haven't done anything for multiple generator case as it was ambiguous. It would be great if you could review it. Thank you. \n@jksuom what can be done in case if the expression given is a constant (without any generators)? For example:  `sqf_list(1)`. We won't be able to construct a polynomial and PolificationFailed error will be raised.\nI think that the error can be raised. It is typical of many polynomial functions that they don't work with constant expressions.",
