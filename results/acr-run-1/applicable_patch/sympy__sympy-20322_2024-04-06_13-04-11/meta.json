Maybe somebody else can look into the problem, why `is_integer` is set wrongly for this expression.\nThe reason `is_integer` is incorrect for the expression is because it returns here:\r\nhttps://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/1b4529a95ef641c2fc15889091b281644069d20e/sympy/core/mul.py#L1274-L1277\r\nThat is due to\r\n```julia\r\nIn [1]: e = Mul(-1,Mul(1,Pow(2,-1,evaluate=False),evaluate=False),evaluate=False)                                                              \r\n\r\nIn [2]: fraction(e)                                                                                                                            \r\nOut[2]: (-1/2, 1)\r\n```\r\nIt seems that the `1/2` is carried into the numerator by fraction giving a denominator of one.\r\n\r\nYou can see the fraction function here:\r\nhttps://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/1b4529a95ef641c2fc15889091b281644069d20e/sympy/simplify/radsimp.py#L1071-L1098\r\n\r\nThe check `term.is_Rational` will not match an unevaluated `Mul(1, Rational(1, 2), evaluate=False)` so that gets carried into the numerator.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the root of the problem is the fact that we have unflattened args and `Mul.make_args` hasn't extracted them:\r\n```julia\r\nIn [3]: Mul.make_args(e)                                                                                                                       \r\nOut[3]: \r\n\u239b      1\u239e\r\n\u239c-1, 1\u22c5\u2500\u239f\r\n\u239d      2\u23a0\r\n```\r\nThe `make_args` function does not recurse into the args:\r\nhttps://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/1b4529a95ef641c2fc15889091b281644069d20e/sympy/core/operations.py#L425-L428\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if `make_args` should recurse. An easier fix would be to recurse into any nested Muls in `fraction`.\nWhat about not setting `is_integer` if `evaluate=False` is set on an expression or one of its sub-expressions? Actually I think one cannot expect `is_integer` to be set correctly without evaluating.\nThat sounds like a good solution. As a safeguard, another one is to not remove the integer summands from `ceiling` if `evaluate=False`; it could be considered as an evaluation of ceiling w.r.t. its arguments.\nThere is no way to tell if `evaluate=False` was used in general when creating the `Mul`. It's also not possible in general to know if evaluating the Muls would lead to a different result without evaluating them. We should *not* evaluate the Muls as part of an assumptions query. If they are unevaluated then the user did that deliberately and it is not up to `_eval_is_integer` to evaluate them.\r\n\r\nThis was discussed when changing this to `fraction(..., exact=True)`: https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19182#issuecomment-619398889\r\n\r\nI think that using `fraction` at all is probably too much but we should certainly not replace that with something that evaluates the object.\nHm, does one really need to know whether `evaluate=False` was used? It looks like all we need is the expression tree to decide if `is_integer` is set to `True`. What about setting `is_integer=True` in a conservative way, i.e. only for these expression nodes:\r\n\r\n- atoms: type `Integer`, constants `Zero` and `One` and symbols with appropriate assumptions\r\n- `Add` and `Mul` if all args have `is_integer==True`\r\n- `Pow` if base and exponent have `is_integer==True` and exponent is non-negative\r\n\r\nI probably missed some cases, but you get the general idea. Would that work? The current implementation would only change in a few places, I guess - to a simpler form. Then also for `ceiling` we do not need to check for `evaluate=False`; its implementation could remain unchanged.\nWhat you describe is more or less the way that it already works. You can find more detail in the (unmerged) #20090  \r\n\r\nThe code implementing this is in the `Mul._eval_is_integer` function I linked to above.\n@oscarbenjamin @coproc Sorry for bugging, but are there any plans about this? We cannot use sympy with Python 3.8 anymore in our package because of this...\nI explained a possible solution above:\r\n\r\n> An easier fix would be to recurse into any nested Muls in `fraction`.\r\n\r\nI think this just needs someone to make a PR for that. If the PR comes *very* quickly it can be included in the 1.7 release (I'm going to put out the RC just as soon as #20307 is fixed).\nThis diff will do it:\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/sympy/simplify/radsimp.py b/sympy/simplify/radsimp.py\r\nindex 4609da209c..879ffffdc9 100644\r\n--- a/sympy/simplify/radsimp.py\r\n+++ b/sympy/simplify/radsimp.py\r\n@@ -1074,7 +1074,14 @@ def fraction(expr, exact=False):\r\n \r\n     numer, denom = [], []\r\n \r\n-    for term in Mul.make_args(expr):\r\n+    def mul_args(e):\r\n+        for term in Mul.make_args(e):\r\n+            if term.is_Mul:\r\n+                yield from mul_args(term)\r\n+            else:\r\n+                yield term\r\n+\r\n+    for term in mul_args(expr):\r\n         if term.is_commutative and (term.is_Pow or isinstance(term, exp)):\r\n             b, ex = term.as_base_exp()\r\n             if ex.is_negative:\r\n```\r\nWith that we get:\r\n```python\r\n>>> e = Mul(-1,Mul(1,Pow(2,-1,evaluate=False),evaluate=False),evaluate=False)\r\n>>> fraction(e) \r\n(-1, 2)\r\n>>> Mul(-1,Mul(1,Pow(2,-1,evaluate=False),evaluate=False),evaluate=False).is_integer\r\nFalse\r\n>>> sympy.sympify('ceiling(x-1/2)', evaluate=False)\r\nceiling(x + (-1)*1*1/2)\r\n>>> sympy.sympify('4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)', evaluate=False).simplify()\r\n4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)\r\n>>> sympy.sympify('4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)', evaluate=True).simplify()\r\n4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)\r\n```\r\nIf someone wants to put that diff together with tests for the above into a PR then it can go in.\nsee pull request #20312\r\n\r\nI have added a minimal assertion as test (with the minimal expression from above); that should suffice, I think.\nThank you both so much!\nAs a general rule of thumb, pretty much any function that takes a SymPy expression as input and manipulates it in some way (simplify, solve, integrate, etc.) is liable to give wrong answers if the expression was created with evaluate=False. There is code all over the place that assumes, either explicitly or implicitly, that expressions satisfy various conditions that are true after automatic evaluation happens. For example, if I am reading the PR correctly, there is some code that very reasonably assumes that Mul.make_args(expr) gives the terms of a multiplication. This is not true for evaluate=False because that disables flattening of arguments. \r\n\r\nIf you are working with expressions created with evaluate=False, you should always evaluate them first before trying to pass them to functions like simplify(). The result of simplify would be evaluated anyway, so there's no reason to not do this.\r\n\r\nThis isn't to say I'm necessarily opposed to fixing this issue specifically, but in general I think fixes like this are untenable. There are a handful of things that should definitely work correctly with unevaluated expressions, like the printers, and some very basic expression manipulation functions. I'm less convinced it's a good idea to try to enforce this for something like the assumptions or high level simplification functions. \r\n\r\nThis shows we really need to rethink how we represent unevaluated expressions in SymPy. The fact that you can create an expression that looks just fine, but is actually subtly \"invalid\" for some code is indicative that something is broken in the design. It would be better if unevaluated expressions were more explicitly separate from evaluated ones. Or if expressions just didn't evaluate as much. I'm not sure what the best solution is, just that the current situation isn't ideal.\nI think that the real issue is the fact that `fraction` is not a suitable function to use within the core assumptions system. I'm sure I objected to it being introduced somewhere.\r\n\r\nThe core assumptions should be able to avoid giving True or False erroneously because of unevaluated expressions.\nIn fact here's a worse form of the bug:\r\n```julia\r\nIn [1]: x = Symbol('x', rational=True)                                                                                                                                            \r\n\r\nIn [2]: fraction(x)                                                                                                                                                               \r\nOut[2]: (x, 1)\r\n\r\nIn [3]: y = Symbol('y', rational=True)                                                                                                                                            \r\n\r\nIn [4]: (x*y).is_integer                                                                                                                                                          \r\nOut[4]: True\r\n```\nHere's a better fix:\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/sympy/core/mul.py b/sympy/core/mul.py\r\nindex 46f310b122..01db7d951b 100644\r\n--- a/sympy/core/mul.py\r\n+++ b/sympy/core/mul.py\r\n@@ -1271,18 +1271,34 @@ def _eval_is_integer(self):\r\n             return False\r\n \r\n         # use exact=True to avoid recomputing num or den\r\n-        n, d = fraction(self, exact=True)\r\n-        if is_rational:\r\n-            if d is S.One:\r\n-                return True\r\n-        if d.is_even:\r\n-            if d.is_prime:  # literal or symbolic 2\r\n-                return n.is_even\r\n-            if n.is_odd:\r\n-                return False  # true even if d = 0\r\n-        if n == d:\r\n-            return fuzzy_and([not bool(self.atoms(Float)),\r\n-            fuzzy_not(d.is_zero)])\r\n+        numerators = []\r\n+        denominators = []\r\n+        for a in self.args:\r\n+            if a.is_integer:\r\n+                numerators.append(a)\r\n+            elif a.is_Rational:\r\n+                n, d = a.as_numer_denom()\r\n+                numerators.append(n)\r\n+                denominators.append(d)\r\n+            elif a.is_Pow:\r\n+                b, e = a.as_base_exp()\r\n+                if e is S.NegativeOne and b.is_integer:\r\n+                    denominators.append(b)\r\n+                else:\r\n+                    return\r\n+            else:\r\n+                return\r\n+\r\n+        if not denominators:\r\n+            return True\r\n+\r\n+        odd = lambda ints: all(i.is_odd for i in ints)\r\n+        even = lambda ints: any(i.is_even for i in ints)\r\n+\r\n+        if odd(numerators) and even(denominators):\r\n+            return False\r\n+        elif even(numerators) and denominators == [2]:\r\n+            return True\r\n \r\n     def _eval_is_polar(self):\r\n         has_polar = any(arg.is_polar for arg in self.args)\r\ndiff --git a/sympy/core/tests/test_arit.py b/sympy/core/tests/test_arit.py\r\nindex e05cdf6ac1..c52408b906 100644\r\n--- a/sympy/core/tests/test_arit.py\r\n+++ b/sympy/core/tests/test_arit.py\r\n@@ -391,10 +391,10 @@ def test_Mul_is_integer():\r\n     assert (e/o).is_integer is None\r\n     assert (o/e).is_integer is False\r\n     assert (o/i2).is_integer is False\r\n-    assert Mul(o, 1/o, evaluate=False).is_integer is True\r\n+    #assert Mul(o, 1/o, evaluate=False).is_integer is True\r\n     assert Mul(k, 1/k, evaluate=False).is_integer is None\r\n-    assert Mul(nze, 1/nze, evaluate=False).is_integer is True\r\n-    assert Mul(2., S.Half, evaluate=False).is_integer is False\r\n+    #assert Mul(nze, 1/nze, evaluate=False).is_integer is True\r\n+    #assert Mul(2., S.Half, evaluate=False).is_integer is False\r\n \r\n     s = 2**2**2**Pow(2, 1000, evaluate=False)\r\n     m = Mul(s, s, evaluate=False)\r\n```\r\nI only tested with core tests.
