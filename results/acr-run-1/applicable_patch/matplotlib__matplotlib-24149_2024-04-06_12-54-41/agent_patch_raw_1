```

This modification addresses the issue by providing a fallback value (`np.nan`) when no finite values are found by `_safe_first_finite`. This change prevents the `StopIteration` exception from propagating and causing an unhandled error in scenarios where all input data to `ax.bar` is NaN. This approach maintains the behavior of returning a `BarContainer` with NaN values, aligning with the expected outcome described in the issue.
