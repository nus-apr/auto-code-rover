        "content": "Based on the information collected from the search results, we have a clear picture of where the issue might be originating from:\n\n1. **LogisticRegressionCV Class**: The issue is related to the `LogisticRegressionCV` class in the `sklearn/linear_model/logistic.py` file. The class is initialized with several parameters, including `Cs`, which can be a single value or an array of values specifying the regularization strengths to be used. The error message in the issue suggests that there's a problem when `Cs` is provided as a numpy array.\n\n2. **set_config Function**: The `set_config` function in `sklearn/_config.py` is used to set global configurations for scikit-learn, including the `print_changed_only` parameter. When `print_changed_only` is set to `True`, only the parameters that were set to non-default values will be printed when printing an estimator. This is likely where the issue arises when attempting to print the `LogisticRegressionCV` instance with a numpy array as the `Cs` parameter.\n\nThe error message \"ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\" typically occurs in Python when an operation or function expects a single boolean value, but instead, an array of boolean values is provided. This suggests that somewhere in the code, there's an operation involving the `Cs` parameter that doesn't handle numpy arrays correctly under the `print_changed_only=True` setting.\n\nGiven this context, the next step would be to look into how the `LogisticRegressionCV` class handles the `Cs` parameter, especially in the context of printing the estimator's configuration when `print_changed_only` is set to `True`. Additionally, it would be beneficial to investigate how the global configuration changes made by `set_config` affect the printing of estimator parameters, particularly for parameters that can be numpy arrays.\n\nTo proceed with fixing the issue, we would need to ensure that when `Cs` is a numpy array and `print_changed_only=True`, the code correctly handles the array without raising a ValueError. This might involve modifying how the `Cs` parameter is displayed or evaluated in the context of printing the estimator's configuration."
