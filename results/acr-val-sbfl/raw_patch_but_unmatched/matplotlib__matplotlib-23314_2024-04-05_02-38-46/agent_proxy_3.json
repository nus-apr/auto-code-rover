Given the implementation of `set_visible` in the `Artist` class (`lib/matplotlib/artist.py`), the method itself is correctly designed for general use. Therefore, the bug might not be in the `set_visible` method per se but rather in how the visibility state is managed or rendered for 3D plots. Potential locations to investigate further include:\n    - `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py`: The `Axes3D` class might have specific behaviors or interactions with visibility properties that are not correctly accounted for in the context of 3D plots.\n    - Rendering and event handling mechanisms related to 3D plots in Matplotlib, which might involve files and methods beyond the `Axes3D` class itself, especially those handling the rendering pipeline and event propagation for visibility changes in 3D contexts."
