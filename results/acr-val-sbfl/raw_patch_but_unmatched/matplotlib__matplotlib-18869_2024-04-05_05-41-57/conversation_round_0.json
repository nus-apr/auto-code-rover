For quick version checks, exposing either a `version_info` tuple (which can be compared with other tuples) or a `LooseVersion` instance (which can be properly compared with other strings) would be a small usability improvement.\n(In practice I guess boring string comparisons will work just fine until we hit mpl 3.10 or 4.10 which is unlikely to happen soon, but that feels quite dirty :))\n### Proposed Solution\nI guess I slightly prefer `LooseVersion`, but exposing just a `version_info` tuple is much more common in other packages (and perhaps simpler to understand).  The hardest(?) part is probably just bikeshedding this point :-)\n### Additional context and prior art\n`version_info` is a pretty common thing (citation needed).\n</issue>"
