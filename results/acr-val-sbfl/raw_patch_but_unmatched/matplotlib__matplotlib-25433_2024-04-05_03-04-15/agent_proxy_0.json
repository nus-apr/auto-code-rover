            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how the `RangeSlider` and `Button` widgets are implemented and interact with the figure's drawing and event handling mechanisms in Matplotlib. Specifically, we should investigate how the `on_changed` callback for `RangeSlider` and the `on_clicked` callback for `Button` are handled. Additionally, understanding the behavior of `pyplot.clf()` and `pyplot.draw()` in the context of widget interaction would be beneficial.\n\nGiven this, I will perform the following API calls to gather more context:\n\n1. Search for the `RangeSlider` class to understand its implementation and how the `on_changed` method is supposed to work.\n2. Search for the `Button` class to compare its implementation with `RangeSlider`, focusing on the `on_clicked` method.\n3. Search for the `clf` method in the `pyplot` module to understand its impact on the figure and its elements.\n4. Search for the `draw` method in the `pyplot` module to understand how it updates the figure and its interaction with widgets.\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive understanding of the components involved in the issue.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"RangeSlider\")\nsearch_class(\"Button\")\nsearch_method(\"clf\")\nsearch_method(\"draw\")\n```"
