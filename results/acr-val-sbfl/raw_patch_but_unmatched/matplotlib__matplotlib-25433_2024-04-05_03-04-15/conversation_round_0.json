When doing the same in the button callback on_clicked, everything works fine.\n### Code for reproduction\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot\nimport matplotlib.widgets as widgets\ndef onchanged(values):\nprint(\"on changed\")\nprint(values)\npyplot.clf()\naddElements()\npyplot.draw()\ndef onclick(e):\nprint(\"on click\")\npyplot.clf()\naddElements()\npyplot.draw()\ndef addElements():\nax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.45, 0.8, 0.1])\nglobal slider\nslider = widgets.RangeSlider(ax, \"Test\", valmin=1, valmax=10, valinit=(1, 10))\nslider.on_changed(onchanged)\nax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.30, 0.8, 0.1])\nglobal button\nbutton = widgets.Button(ax, \"Test\")\nbutton.on_clicked(onclick)\naddElements()\npyplot.show()\n```\n### Actual outcome\nThe widgets can't receive any input from a mouse click, when redrawing in the on_changed callback of a range Slider.\nWhen using a button, there is no problem.\n### Expected outcome\nThe range slider callback on_changed behaves the same as the button callback on_clicked.\n### Additional information\nThe problem also occurred on Manjaro with:\n- Python version: 3.10.9\n- Matplotlib version: 3.6.2\n- Matplotlib backend: QtAgg\n- Installation of matplotlib via Linux package manager\n### Operating system\nWindows 10\n### Matplotlib Version\n3.6.2\n### Matplotlib Backend\nTkAgg\n### Python version\n3.11.0\n### Jupyter version\n_No response_\n### Installation\npip\n</issue>"
