However, please note that I can't execute these calls directly in this environment but I will list them as if I were to execute them in a proper environment:\n\n1. To explore how `trigsimp` is implemented and potentially identify where the logic might be failing or could be enhanced to handle the cases mentioned in the issue:\n```\nsearch_code_in_file(\"trigsimp\", \"sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py\")\n```\n\n2. To find tests related to `trigsimp` that might already cover similar cases or to identify where new tests could be added:\n```\nsearch_code_in_file(\"trigsimp\", \"sympy/simplify/tests/test_trigsimp.py\")\n```\n\nThese calls are intended to provide a deeper understanding of how `trigsimp` works and to locate the exact parts of the code that might need modification to address the issue described."
