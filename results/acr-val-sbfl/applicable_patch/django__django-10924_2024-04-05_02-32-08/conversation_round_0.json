Seeing as the place where these files are stored is different on different machines I have the following:\nimport os\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\nclass LocalFiles(models.Model):\nname = models.CharField(max_length=255)\nfile = models.FilePathField(path=os.path.join(settings.LOCAL_FILE_DIR, 'example_dir'))\nNow when running manage.py makemigrations it will resolve the path based on the machine it is being run on. Eg: /home/<username>/server_files/example_dir\nI had to manually change the migration to include the os.path.join() part to not break this when running the migration on production/other machine.\n</issue>"
