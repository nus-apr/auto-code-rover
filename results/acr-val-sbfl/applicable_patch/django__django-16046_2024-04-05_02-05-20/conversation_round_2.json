The error described occurs when attempting to access the first character of a string that is either null or empty, leading to an \"IndexError: string index out of range.\"\n\nThe external tool did not find the exact code snippet `if str_number[0] == '-'` in `django/utils/numberformat.py`, which suggests that the code might be structured differently or the issue description provided an approximation of the problematic code.\n\nTo proceed with fixing the issue, we need to ensure that the `format` function in `django/utils/numberformat.py` can gracefully handle null or empty strings without attempting to access their characters directly. Since the direct search for the problematic code snippet did not yield results, we should look into the `format` function itself to understand its implementation and identify where the null check should be introduced or improved.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next step is to examine the `format` function in the specified file to understand its current handling of string inputs and identify the appropriate place to introduce a fix for the issue.\n\nLet's proceed by searching for the `format` method within the `django/utils/numberformat.py` file to get its implementation details.\n\n---\n\nsearch_method_in_file(\"format\", \"django/utils/numberformat.py\")"
