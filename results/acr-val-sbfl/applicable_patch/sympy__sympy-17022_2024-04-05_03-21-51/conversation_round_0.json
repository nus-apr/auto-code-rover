Inspecting the globals and source code of `f` shows us why we get the result:\n```python\n>>> import inspect\n>>> print(inspect.getsource(f))\ndef _lambdifygenerated(A):\nreturn (I + A)\n>>> f.__globals__['I']\n1j\n```\nThe code printer prints `I`, which is currently being interpreted as a Python built-in complex number. The printer should support printing identity matrices, and signal an error for unsupported expressions that might be misinterpreted.\n</issue>"
