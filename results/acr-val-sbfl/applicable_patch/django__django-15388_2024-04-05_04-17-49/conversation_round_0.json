Manually CTRL-C your dev server (as it won't restart on its own when you save), restart the dev server. Now return to your settings.py file, re-save it, and notice the development server once again detects changes and restarts.\nThis bug prevents the dev server from restarting no matter where you make changes - it is not just scoped to edits to settings.py.\n</issue>"
