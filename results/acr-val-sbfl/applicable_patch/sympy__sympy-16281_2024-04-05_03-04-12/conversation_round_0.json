Keeping everything below the horizontal line is good, but the bottom looks asymmetric, and it makes the \u220f bigger than it needs to be.\n- The \u220f is too fat IMO.\n- It might look better if we extended the top bar. I'm unsure about this.\nCompare this\n```\n\u221e\n\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\n\u2502     \u2502  1\n\u2502     \u2502  \u2500\u2500\n\u2502     \u2502   2\n\u2502     \u2502  n\nn = 1\n```\nThat's still almost twice as wide as the equivalent Sum, but if you make it much skinnier it starts to look bad.\n```\n\u221e\n____\n\u2572\n\u2572   1\n\u2572  \u2500\u2500\n\u2571   2\n\u2571   n\n\u2571\n\u203e\u203e\u203e\u203e\nn = 1\n```\n</issue>"
