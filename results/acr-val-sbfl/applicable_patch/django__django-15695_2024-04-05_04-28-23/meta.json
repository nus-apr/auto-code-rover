In https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/27064, For backwards operations with unnamed old indexes, RenameIndex is a noop. From my understanding, when an unnamed index becomes \"named\", the idea was that it remained \"named\" even when reversing the operation. Yes, sorry, I should predict that this is going to cause naming issues. I guess the implementation is not entirely correct, since it doesn't allow idempotency of the operation when applying/un-applying it. I'll try to find a fix We should be able to find the old name with SchemaEditor._create_index_name().",
