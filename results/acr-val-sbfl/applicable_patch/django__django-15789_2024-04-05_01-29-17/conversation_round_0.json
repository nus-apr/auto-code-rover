It looks like django.utils.html.json_script is a good utility for that, however the JSON encoder is hardcoded to DjangoJSONEncoder. I think it would be nice to be able to pass a custom encoder class.\nBy the way, django.utils.html.json_script is not documented (only its template filter counterpart is), would it be a good thing to add to the docs?\n</issue>"
