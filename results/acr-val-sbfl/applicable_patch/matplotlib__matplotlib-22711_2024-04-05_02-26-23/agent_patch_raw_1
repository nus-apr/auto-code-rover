This patch corrects the issue by ensuring that the last point of the polygon (`xy[4]`) is set to be the same as the first point (`xy[0]`), effectively closing the polygon. This approach maintains the integrity of the polygon's shape for both vertical and horizontal orientations of the `RangeSlider`, without causing an `IndexError`.
