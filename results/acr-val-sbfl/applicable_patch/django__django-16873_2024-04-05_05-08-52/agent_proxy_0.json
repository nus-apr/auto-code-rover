The issue points out that when `autoescape` is off, the joining string (`some_var` in the test case) is still being escaped, which is not the expected behavior. \n\nGiven this, we should look into the implementation of the `join` filter and how it interacts with the `autoescape` setting. Specifically, we need to find the code responsible for applying the `join` filter and check if and how it considers the `autoescape` setting.\n\nLet's start by searching for the implementation of the `join` filter and the autoescape mechanism to understand their workings better.\n\n1. `search_method(\"join\")` - This will help us find the implementation of the `join` filter.\n2. `search_code(\"autoescape off\")` - This will help us understand how the `autoescape` setting is managed and applied in templates."
