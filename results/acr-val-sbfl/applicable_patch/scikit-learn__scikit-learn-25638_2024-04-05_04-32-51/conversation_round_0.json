Because the dtypes become `object` dtype when converted to numpy arrays we get `ValueError: Mix type of y not allowed, got types {'binary', 'unknown'}`:\nRepro with sklearn 1.2.1\n```py\nimport pandas as pd\nimport pytest\nfrom sklearn.utils.multiclass import unique_labels\nfor dtype in [\"Int64\", \"Float64\", \"boolean\"]:\ny_true = pd.Series([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], dtype=dtype)\ny_predicted = pd.Series([0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=\"int64\")\nwith pytest.raises(ValueError, match=\"Mix type of y not allowed, got types\"):\nunique_labels(y_true, y_predicted)\n```\n### Describe your proposed solution\nWe should get the same behavior as when `int64`, `float64`, and `bool` dtypes are used, which is no error:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.utils.multiclass import unique_labels\nfor dtype in [\"int64\", \"float64\", \"bool\"]:\ny_true = pd.Series([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], dtype=dtype)\ny_predicted = pd.Series([0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=\"int64\")\nunique_labels(y_true, y_predicted)\n```\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\nOur current workaround is to convert the data to numpy arrays with the corresponding dtype that works prior to passing it into `unique_labels`.\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"
