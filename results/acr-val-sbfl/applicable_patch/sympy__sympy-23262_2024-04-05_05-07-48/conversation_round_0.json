I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\n```python\nimport inspect\nfrom sympy import lambdify\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\n```\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\n```\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\n```\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\n```\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\n```\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple.\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\n```python\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\n```\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\n```\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\n```\nThis result is expected.\nNot sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you.\n</issue>"
