        "content": "<issue>Add a file mode parameter to flask.Config.from_file()\nPython 3.11 introduced native TOML support with the `tomllib` package. This could work nicely with the `flask.Config.from_file()` method as an easy way to load TOML config files:\n```python\napp.config.from_file(\"config.toml\", tomllib.load)\n```\nHowever, `tomllib.load()` takes an object readable in binary mode, while `flask.Config.from_file()` opens a file in text mode, resulting in this error:\n```\nTypeError: File must be opened in binary mode, e.g. use `open('foo.toml', 'rb')`\n```\nWe can get around this with a more verbose expression, like loading from a file opened with the built-in `open()` function and passing the `dict` to `app.Config.from_mapping()`:\n```python\n# We have to repeat the path joining that from_file() does\nwith open(os.path.join(app.config.root_path, \"config.toml\"), \"rb\") as file:\napp.config.from_mapping(tomllib.load(file))\n```\nBut adding a file mode parameter to `flask.Config.from_file()` would enable the use of a simpler expression. E.g.:\n```python\napp.config.from_file(\"config.toml\", tomllib.load, mode=\"b\")\n```\n</issue>"
