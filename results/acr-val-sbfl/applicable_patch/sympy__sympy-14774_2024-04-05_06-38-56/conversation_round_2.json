        "content": "Based on the issue description and the search results, the problem lies within the handling of inverse trigonometric functions in the LaTeX printer module of SymPy, specifically in the way full names for the inverse trigonometric functions `acsc` and `asec` are generated. The issue points out that while `asin(x)` correctly translates to `\\\\arcsin{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}` when `inv_trig_style=\"full\"` is specified, `acsc(x)` does not translate to `\\\\operatorname{arccsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}`, but rather stays as `\\\\operatorname{acsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}`, which is inconsistent with the expected output.\n\nThe external analysis tool's output, while providing insights into potentially problematic areas within the SymPy codebase, does not directly relate to the issue at hand, which is specifically about the LaTeX representation of inverse trigonometric functions. The methods and classes identified by the tool are more general and pertain to evaluation and definition of functions and powers, rather than LaTeX printing.\n\nThe search API call to `search_code_in_file` for the snippet `inv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acot\"]` in `sympy/printing/latex.py` directly addresses the issue. The search result confirms the presence of the code snippet that needs modification, located within the `_print_Function` method of the `LatexPrinter` class. This method is responsible for generating the LaTeX representation of functions, and the `inv_trig_table` array is used to identify inverse trigonometric functions for special handling.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the `inv_trig_table` array should be updated to include `acsc` and `asec`, as suggested in the issue description. This change will allow the LaTeX printer to correctly handle these functions when `inv_trig_style=\"full\"` is specified, generating the expected LaTeX code for `acsc(x)` and `asec(x)`.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next step would be to prepare a patch that updates the `inv_trig_table` array in `sympy/printing/latex.py` as per the suggestion in the issue description. This would involve modifying the line:\n\n```python\ninv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acot\"]\n```\n\nto:\n\n```python\ninv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acsc\", \"asec\", \"acot\"]\n```\n\nThis change should be tested to ensure that it resolves the issue without introducing any new problems."
