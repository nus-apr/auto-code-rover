2024-04-04 19:21:53 Raw model response: ChatCompletionMessage(content="The issue describes a problem with how `Session.resolve_redirects` in the `requests` library handles HTTP method changes during redirection chains. Specifically, it mentions that when a POST request is redirected with a 303 (See Other) status code, it should change to a GET request, which is correct behavior according to HTTP standards. However, if this GET request is then redirected again with a 307 (Temporary Redirect) status code, the method should remain as GET. The problem arises because `Session.resolve_redirects` incorrectly starts each iteration by copying the original request object, leading to the method reverting back to POST instead of staying as GET.\n\nFrom the provided code snippet of the `resolve_redirects` method in `requests/sessions.py`, we can see how redirections are handled. The method iterates over each redirect response and prepares a new request for the next location. The critical part of the code that determines the method for the next request checks the status code of the response and explicitly sets the method to 'GET' for specific status codes (303, 302, and in some cases, 301 when the original method is 'POST'). However, it starts by copying the original request object for each iteration, which includes copying the original HTTP method.\n\nThis behavior can lead to incorrect method selection for subsequent requests in a redirection chain, as described in the issue. The solution would likely involve modifying how the request method is determined and preserved across redirects, especially after a 303 See Other response has changed the method from POST to GET. The fix should ensure that once the method has been changed to GET due to a 303 response, any further redirects (like a 307 Temporary Redirect) should not revert the method back to the original POST method. \n\nTo address this, a patch would need to adjust the logic within the `resolve_redirects` method to correctly track and apply the HTTP method changes across redirects, ensuring compliance with the HTTP standards and expected behavior.", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

  'content': 'The issue describes a problem with how `Session.resolve_redirects` in the `requests` library handles HTTP method changes during redirection '
             'chains. Specifically, it mentions that when a POST request is redirected with a 303 (See Other) status code, it should change to a GET request, '
             'which is correct behavior according to HTTP standards. However, if this GET request is then redirected again with a 307 (Temporary Redirect) '
             'status code, the method should remain as GET. The problem arises because `Session.resolve_redirects` incorrectly starts each iteration by '
             'copying the original request object, leading to the method reverting back to POST instead of staying as GET.\n'
             '\n'
             'From the provided code snippet of the `resolve_redirects` method in `requests/sessions.py`, we can see how redirections are handled. The method '
             'iterates over each redirect response and prepares a new request for the next location. The critical part of the code that determines the method '
             "for the next request checks the status code of the response and explicitly sets the method to 'GET' for specific status codes (303, 302, and in "
             "some cases, 301 when the original method is 'POST'). However, it starts by copying the original request object for each iteration, which "
             'includes copying the original HTTP method.\n'
             '\n'
             'This behavior can lead to incorrect method selection for subsequent requests in a redirection chain, as described in the issue. The solution '
             'would likely involve modifying how the request method is determined and preserved across redirects, especially after a 303 See Other response '
             'has changed the method from POST to GET. The fix should ensure that once the method has been changed to GET due to a 303 response, any further '
             'redirects (like a 307 Temporary Redirect) should not revert the method back to the original POST method. \n'
             '\n'
             'To address this, a patch would need to adjust the logic within the `resolve_redirects` method to correctly track and apply the HTTP method '

By checking if the previous response was a 303 See Other and using the method from the last response's request if so, we ensure that the method change is preserved across subsequent redirects.\n  \n- **Modification 2**: Ensures that the method used for preparing the next request in the redirection chain is taken from the `prepared_request`, which might have been updated in the previous iteration of the loop.
