Based on the instructions and the context provided, there's no need for further search API calls as we have already identified the potential areas for the bug and the necessary context to proceed with formulating a solution. My previous response was intended to conclude the analysis phase and suggest potential bug locations based on the information gathered. \n\nTo clarify, there's no additional request for search API calls at this moment. The analysis suggests that the focus should be on:\n\n- **`django/contrib/postgres/fields/array.py`**, specifically the `ArrayField` class and its `formfield` method, for adjustments to ensure correct handling of default values.\n  \n- The **Django admin form submission logic** related to inline forms, particularly how validation errors and default values are managed across submissions. While specific files and methods were not identified through search results, the analysis points towards areas within the Django admin system, likely involving form processing and validation error handling.\n\nGiven this understanding, we are ready to proceed without further search API calls."
