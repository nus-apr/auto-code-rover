Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the information gathered from the search results, we have identified the `Signal` class and the `send_robust` method within it. The `Signal` class is located in `django/dispatch/dispatcher.py`. The `send_robust` method is designed to send a signal from the sender to all connected receivers, catching errors that occur in the process.\n\nHere's a summary of the `send_robust` method's behavior as per the code snippet:\n\n- The method sends a signal from a sender to all connected receivers.\n- It accepts any Python object as the sender and named arguments that will be passed to the receivers.\n- It returns a list of tuple pairs `[(receiver, response), ...]`.\n- If a receiver raises an error (any subclass of `Exception`), the method catches this error and returns the error instance as the result for that receiver instead of stopping the signal dispatch process.\n- The method iterates over all live receivers (those that haven't been garbage collected) and calls each receiver with the provided arguments. If an exception is raised during the execution of a receiver, it catches the exception and appends a tuple of the receiver and the exception to the `responses` list. If no exception is raised, it appends a tuple of the receiver and the response.\n\nThe issue reported suggests that while `send_robust` does catch exceptions raised by receivers, it does not log these exceptions. This behavior can make debugging difficult because developers or system administrators might not be aware of errors occurring during signal handling unless they manually inspect the return values of `send_robust`.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to modify the `send_robust` method to include a logging statement within the `except` block that catches the exceptions. This will ensure that any exceptions raised by receivers are logged, making them visible in error handling tools like Sentry.\n\nNext steps involve drafting a patch to add logging functionality to the `send_robust` method."
