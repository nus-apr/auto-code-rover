The location for potential modifications, which is directly related to the issue described, is:\n\n- **Buggy files and methods**:\n  - File: `sympy/series/gruntz.py`\n  - Method: `sign`\n\nThis method is where the enhancement to rewrite the `sign` function in terms of `Abs` while carefully handling the zero case should be implemented."
