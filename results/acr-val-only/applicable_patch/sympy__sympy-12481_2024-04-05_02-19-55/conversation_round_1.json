        "content": "Based on the information provided from the search result, the `Permutation` class is located in the file `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`. This class contains a variety of methods related to permutations, including constructors, properties, and operations on permutations.\n\nThe issue at hand involves the constructor of the `Permutation` class failing when non-disjoint cycles are provided as input. The expected behavior, as described in the issue, is for the constructor to apply the non-disjoint cycles in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation, rather than raising a `ValueError`.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to look into the constructor method `__new__` of the `Permutation` class, as this is likely where the input cycles are processed and where the error is raised for non-disjoint cycles. Understanding how the constructor currently handles the input cycles will be crucial in devising a patch that allows for the desired behavior.\n\nGiven this context, the next step in addressing the issue would involve examining the implementation of the `__new__` method within the `Permutation` class to identify where and how it checks for disjoint cycles and raises the `ValueError`. From there, we can modify the logic to instead apply non-disjoint cycles in the specified order and construct the resulting permutation."
