            "content": "To analyze and address the issue effectively, we need to understand the implementation details of the classes and methods involved in the exception. Specifically, we should look into the `BlockMatrix` class, the `_blockmul` method within it, and how `ZeroMatrix` and `Zero` objects are handled during block multiplication. The error messages indicate that the issue arises because `Zero` objects do not have a `cols` attribute, which is expected by the `colblocksizes` method in the `BlockMatrix` class.\n\nLet's start by investigating the relevant classes and methods:\n\n1. **BlockMatrix Class**: To understand how block matrices are represented and manipulated.\n2. **ZeroMatrix Class**: To understand the properties and methods of the `ZeroMatrix` object.\n3. **_blockmul Method in BlockMatrix Class**: To understand the block multiplication logic that leads to the issue.\n4. **colblocksizes Method in BlockMatrix Class**: To understand how column block sizes are calculated, which is where the error occurs.\n\nBased on these requirements, we will use the following search API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"BlockMatrix\")`\n- `search_class(\"ZeroMatrix\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_blockmul\", \"BlockMatrix\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"colblocksizes\", \"BlockMatrix\")`"
