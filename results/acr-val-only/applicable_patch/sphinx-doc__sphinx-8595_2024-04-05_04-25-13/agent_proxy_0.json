            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how the Sphinx autodoc extension processes the `__all__` attribute in modules and how it decides which members to document. The bug report indicates that an empty `__all__` list is being ignored, leading to all functions being documented instead of none. \n\nGiven this context, I will perform the following API calls to gather more information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"AutoDoc\")`: Since the issue is related to the autodoc functionality of Sphinx, searching for a class related to autodoc (like `AutoDoc` or similarly named classes) could provide insight into where the handling of the `__all__` attribute is implemented.\n\n2. `search_method(\"process_members\")`: This method name is a guess based on common naming conventions for processing members of a module or class in documentation tools. If there's a method responsible for deciding which members to document based on the `__all__` attribute, it might be named something like this.\n\n3. `search_code(\"__all__\")`: Searching for the `__all__` string in the codebase can help locate where it is being checked or used within the autodoc extension or related modules. This can lead us directly to the logic that needs to be patched.\n\nThese searches are designed to locate the relevant parts of the codebase where the issue might be originating from, allowing for a more targeted approach to patching the bug."
