        "content": "The issue revolves around the `parse_http_date` function in `django/utils/http.py`, which is responsible for parsing dates formatted according to HTTP RFC7231 section 7.1.1.1. This function supports three formats, with a particular focus on handling dates with two-digit years, as specified by RFC850 and mentioned in RFC7231 and RFC2822. The current implementation uses a hardcoded logic to interpret two-digit years: years less than 70 are considered to be in the 2000s (2000-2069), and years between 70 and 99 are considered to be in the late 20th century (1970-1999).\n\nThe issue points out that this logic does not comply with the more dynamic interpretation suggested by RFC7231, which states that a two-digit year that appears to be more than 50 years in the future should be interpreted as representing the most recent year in the past that had the same last two digits. This means the logic should not be hardcoded but should instead dynamically calculate the year based on the current date to decide whether a two-digit year belongs to the past or the future.\n\nTo address this issue, the patch needs to modify the `parse_http_date` function to implement a dynamic check for two-digit years, ensuring that it adheres to the guidelines set forth in RFC7231. This involves calculating the current year and determining whether the two-digit year, when interpreted as being in the 20th or 21st century, would appear to be more than 50 years in the future, and adjusting the interpretation accordingly."
