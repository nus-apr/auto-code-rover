Additionally, understanding the context in which these are used, especially the `Test` class and its `hello_world` method, could provide valuable insights. Here are the API calls that would help gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_method(\"method_decorator\")`: This will help us understand how the `method_decorator` is implemented and possibly why it doesn't preserve the attributes of the function it decorates.\n\n2. `search_method(\"logger\")`: By examining the `logger` function, we can see how it wraps the original function and why it might be causing issues with partial objects.\n\n3. `search_class(\"Test\")`: Understanding the `Test` class will provide context on how the `method_decorator` and `logger` are being used, especially in relation to the `hello_world` method.\n\n4. `search_method_in_class(\"hello_world\", \"Test\")`: This will give us specific details on how the `hello_world` method is implemented within the `Test` class. \n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of the components involved in the issue, allowing us to devise an appropriate solution."
