Additionally, we should look into how the `NeighborsHeap` class is initialized since the error originates from there. Here are the API calls that would be most useful for gathering the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"NearestNeighbors\")`: This will help us understand the `NearestNeighbors` class, where the issue with the `n_neighbors` parameter validation might be addressed.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"NearestNeighbors\")`: To see how the `fit` method of the `NearestNeighbors` class handles the `n_neighbors` parameter.\n\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"kneighbors\", \"NearestNeighbors\")`: To investigate how the `kneighbors` method deals with the `n_neighbors` parameter, especially since the issue mentions that `neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)` should also work.\n\n4. `search_class(\"NeighborsHeap\")`: Since the error trace points to the `NeighborsHeap` class, understanding this class will be crucial in identifying where the type error is thrown.\n\nThese searches will provide a comprehensive view of how `n_neighbors` is used and validated across the relevant parts of the codebase, allowing us to devise a suitable patch."
