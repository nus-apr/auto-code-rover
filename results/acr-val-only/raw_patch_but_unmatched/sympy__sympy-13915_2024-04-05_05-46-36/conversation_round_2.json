Given the nature of the issue, which involves a substitution leading to an undefined expression and the calculation of a limit as a workaround, we should focus on the core implementations of these methods. The `subs` method in `sympy/core/basic.py` and the `limit` method in `sympy/series/limits.py` are likely the most relevant to the issue at hand, as these files are part of the core and series modules of SymPy, which deal with symbolic mathematics and series expansions, respectively.\n\nThe absence of direct references to handling \"undefined expressions\" in the codebase suggests that the handling of undefined expressions might be implicit or managed through exceptions or conditional checks within the methods themselves rather than through a dedicated mechanism.\n\nTo proceed with diagnosing and potentially patching the issue, we should examine the implementation details of the `subs` method in `sympy/core/basic.py` and the `limit` method in `sympy/series/limits.py`. These examinations will help us understand how SymPy currently handles cases where a substitution leads to an undefined expression and how it calculates limits in potentially undefined scenarios. This insight will be crucial for developing a patch that addresses the issue without introducing unintended side effects.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps involve deeper examination of the `subs` and `limit` methods' implementations:\n\n- search_method_in_file(\"subs\", \"sympy/core/basic.py\")\n- search_method_in_file(\"limit\", \"sympy/series/limits.py\")"
