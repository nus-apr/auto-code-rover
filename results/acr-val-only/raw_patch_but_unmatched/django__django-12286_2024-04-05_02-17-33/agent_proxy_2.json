To do this, we need to look more closely at the system checks related to language settings.\n\nLet's construct a more targeted search API call to find the specific function or method within `django/core/checks/translation.py` that implements the check raising `translation.E004`. This will help us identify the exact buggy location:\n\n```python\nsearch_code_in_file(\"translation.E004\", \"django/core/checks/translation.py\")\n```\n\nThis search is designed to find the exact piece of code within the specified file that references `translation.E004`, which should lead us directly to the logic that needs to be patched."
