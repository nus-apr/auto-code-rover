## 👋 Overview

AutoCodeRover is a fully automated approach for resolving GitHub issues (bug fixing and feature addition) where LLMs are combined with analysis and debugging capabilities to prioritize patch locations ultimately leading to a patch.

[Update on June 20, 2024] AutoCodeRover(v20240620) now resolves **30.67%** of issues (pass@1) in SWE-bench lite! AutoCodeRover achieved this efficacy while being economical - each task costs **less than $0.7** and is completed within **7 mins**!

</p>

[April 08, 2024] First release of AutoCodeRover(v20240408) resolves **19%** of issues in [SWE-bench lite](https://www.swebench.com/lite.html) (pass@1), improving over the current state-of-the-art efficacy of AI software engineers.


AutoCodeRover works in two stages:

- 🔎 Context retrieval: The LLM is provided with code search APIs to navigate the codebase and collect relevant context.
- 💊 Patch generation: The LLM tries to write a patch, based on retrieved context.

### ✨ Highlights

AutoCodeRover has two unique features:

- Code search APIs are *Program Structure Aware*. Instead of searching over files by plain string matching, AutoCodeRover searches for relevant code context (methods/classes) in the abstract syntax tree.
- When a test suite is available, AutoCodeRover can take advantage of test cases to achieve an even higher repair rate, by performing *statistical fault localization*.

## ✔️ Example: Django Issue #32347

As an example, AutoCodeRover successfully fixed issue [#32347](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32347) of Django. See the demo video for the full process:

https://github.com/nus-apr/auto-code-rover/assets/48704330/719c7a56-40b8-4f3d-a90e-0069e37baad3

### Enhancement: leveraging test cases

AutoCodeRover can resolve even more issues, if test cases are available. See an example in the video:

https://github.com/nus-apr/auto-code-rover/assets/48704330/26c9d5d4-04e0-4b98-be55-61c1d10a36e5

## 🚀 Setup & Running

### Setup API key and environment

We recommend running AutoCodeRover in a Docker container.

Set the `OPENAI_KEY` env var to your [OpenAI key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-openai-api-key):

```
export OPENAI_KEY=sk-YOUR-OPENAI-API-KEY-HERE
```

For Anthropic model, Set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var can be found [here](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/getting-started-with-the-api)

```
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api...
```

The same with `GROQ_API_KEY`

Build and start the docker image for the AutoCodeRover tool:

```
docker build -f Dockerfile.minimal -t acr .
docker run -it -e OPENAI_KEY="${OPENAI_KEY:-OPENAI_API_KEY}" acr
```

### Setup: local mode

Alternatively, you can have a local copy of AutoCodeRover and manage python dependencies with `environment.yml`.
This is the recommended setup for running SWE-bench experiments with AutoCodeRover.
With a working conda installation, do `conda env create -f environment.yml`.
Similarly, set `OPENAI_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your shell before running AutoCodeRover.

## Running AutoCodeRover

You can run AutoCodeRover in three modes:

1. GitHub issue mode: Run ACR on a live GitHub issue by providing a link to the issue page.
2. Local issue mode: Run ACR on a local repository and a file containing the issue description.
3. SWE-bench mode: Run ACR on SWE-bench task instances. (local setup of ACR recommend.)

### [GitHub issue mode] Set up and run on new GitHub issues

If you want to use AutoCodeRover for new GitHub issues in a project, prepare the following:

- Link to clone the project (used for `git clone ...`).
- Commit hash of the project version for AutoCodeRover to work on (used for `git checkout ...`).
- Link to the GitHub issue page.

Then, in the docker container (or your local copy of AutoCodeRover), run the following commands to set up the target project
and generate patch:

```
cd /opt/auto-code-rover
conda activate auto-code-rover
PYTHONPATH=. python app/main.py github-issue --output-dir output --setup-dir setup --model gpt-4o-2024-05-13 --model-temperature 0.2 --task-id <task id> --clone-link <link for cloning the project> --commit-hash <any version that has the issue> --issue-link <link to issue page>
```
Here is an example command for running ACR on an issue from the langchain GitHub issue tracker:

```
PYTHONPATH=. python app/main.py github-issue --output-dir output --setup-dir setup --model gpt-4o-2024-05-13 --model-temperature 0.2 --task-id langchain-20453 --clone-link https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain.git --commit-hash cb6e5e5 --issue-link https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues/20453
```

The `<task id>` can be any string used to identify this issue.

If patch generation is successful, the path to the generated patch will be written to a file named `selected_patch.json` in the output directory.

### [Local issue mode] Set up and run on local repositories and local issues

Instead of cloning a remote project and run ACR on an online issue, you can also prepare the local repository and issue beforehand,
if that suits the use case.

For running ACR on a local issue and local codebase, prepare a local codebase and write an issue description into a file,
and run the following commands:

```
cd /opt/auto-code-rover
conda activate auto-code-rover
PYTHONPATH=. python app/main.py local-issue --output-dir output --model gpt-4o-2024-05-13 --model-temperature 0.2 --task-id <task id> --local-repo <path to the local project repository> --issue-file <path to the file containing issue description>
```

If patch generation is successful, the path to the generated patch will be written to a file named `selected_patch.json` in the output directory.

### [SWE-bench mode] Set up and run on SWE-bench tasks

This mode is for running ACR on existing issue tasks contained in SWE-bench.

#### Set up

For SWE-bench mode, we recommend setting up ACR on a host machine, instead of running it in docker mode.

Firstly, set up the SWE-bench task instances locally.

1. Clone [this SWE-bench fork](https://github.com/yuntongzhang/SWE-bench) and follow the [installation instruction](https://github.com/yuntongzhang/SWE-bench?tab=readme-ov-file#to-install) to install dependencies.

2. Put the tasks to be run into a file, one per line:

```
cd <SWE-bench-path>
echo django__django-11133 > tasks.txt
```

Or if running on arm64 (e.g. Apple silicon), try this one which doesn't depend on Python 3.6 (which isn't supported in this env):

```
echo django__django-16041 > tasks.txt
```

Then, set up these tasks by running:
3. Set up these tasks in the file by running:

```
cd <SWE-bench-path>
conda activate swe-bench
python harness/run_setup.py --log_dir logs --testbed testbed --result_dir setup_result --subset_file tasks.txt
```

Once the setup for this task is completed, the following two lines will be printed:

```
setup_map is saved to setup_result/setup_map.json
tasks_map is saved to setup_result/tasks_map.json
```

The `testbed` directory will now contain the cloned source code of the target project.
A conda environment will also be created for this task instance.

_If you want to set up multiple tasks together, put multiple ids in `tasks.txt` and follow the same steps._

#### Run a single task in SWE-bench

Before running the task (`django__django-11133` here), make sure it has been set up as mentioned [above](#set-up-one-or-more-tasks-in-swe-bench).

```
cd <AutoCodeRover-path>
conda activate auto-code-rover
PYTHONPATH=. python app/main.py swe-bench --model gpt-4o-2024-05-13 --setup-map <SWE-bench-path>/setup_result/setup_map.json --tasks-map <SWE-bench-path>/setup_result/tasks_map.json --output-dir output --task django__django-11133
```

The output for a run (e.g. for `django__django-11133`) can be found at a location like this: `output/applicable_patch/django__django-11133_yyyy-MM-dd_HH-mm-ss/` (the date-time field in the directory name will be different depending on when the experiment was run).

Path to the final generated patch is written in a file named `selected_patch.json` in the output directory.

#### Run multiple tasks in SWE-bench

First, put the id's of all tasks to run in a file, one per line. Suppose this file is `tasks.txt`, the tasks can be run with

```
cd <AutoCodeRover-path>
conda activate auto-code-rover
PYTHONPATH=. python app/main.py swe-bench --model gpt-4o-2024-05-13 --setup-map <SWE-bench-path>/setup_result/setup_map.json --tasks-map <SWE-bench-path>/setup_result/tasks_map.json --output-dir output --task-list-file <SWE-bench-path>/tasks.txt
```

**NOTE**: make sure that the tasks in `tasks.txt` have all been set up in SWE-bench. See the steps [above](#set-up-one-or-more-tasks-in-swe-bench).

#### Using a config file

Alternatively, a config file can be used to specify all parameters and tasks to run. See `conf/example.conf` for an example.
Also see [EXPERIMENT.md](EXPERIMENT.md) for the details of the items in a conf file.
A config file can be used by:

```
python scripts/run.py conf/example.conf
```

### Using a different model

AutoCodeRover works with different foundation models. You can set the foundation model to be used with the `--model` command line argument.

The current list of supported models:

|  | Model | AutoCodeRover cmd line argument |
|:--------------:|---------------|--------------|

> [!NOTE]
> Using the Groq models on a free plan can cause the context limit to be exceeded, even on simple issues.

> [!NOTE]
> Some notes on running ACR with local models such as llama3:
> 1. Before using the llama3 models, please [install ollama](https://ollama.com/download/linux) and download the corresponding models with ollama (e.g. `ollama pull llama3`).
> 2. You can run ollama server on the host machine, and ACR in its container. ACR will attempt to communicate to the ollama server on host.
> 3. If your setup is ollama in host + ACR in its container, we recommend installing [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) on the host, in addition to the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/).
>     - Docker Desktop contains Docker Engine, and also has a virtual machine which makes it easier to access the host ports from within a container. With Docker Desktop, this setup will work without additional effort.
>     - When the docker installation is only Docker Engine, you may need to add either `--net=host` or `--add-host host.docker.internal=host-gateway` to the `docker run` command when starting the ACR container, so that ACR can communicate with the ollama server on the host machine.
